4. ✅ `Models/APIModels.swift` - API request/response models

### Services
5. ✅ `Services/APIService.swift` - Network service (refactored)

### Info Feature
6. ✅ `Features/Info/Views/InfoView.swift`
7. ✅ `Features/Info/Views/AddPreferenceSheet.swift`
8. ✅ `Features/Info/Views/PreferencesManagerView.swift`
9. ✅ `Features/Info/Components/ActivePreferencesSection.swift`

### App Files (moved)
17. ✅ `App/AppView.swift`
18. ✅ `App/supabase.swift`

---

## 🗑️ Files Removed (6 old files)

1. ❌ `NavigationViews.swift` → Split into feature modules
2. ❌ `APIService.swift` → Moved to Services/
3. ❌ `FloatingNavigationBar.swift` → Moved to Shared/
4. ❌ `AuthView.swift` → Moved to Features/Profile/
5. ❌ `AppView.swift` → Moved to App/
6. ❌ `supabase.swift` → Moved to App/

---

## 🔄 Files Modified

1. ✅ `ContentView.swift` - Removed Color extension (now in Core/)

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Centralized Theme System**
```swift
// Before: Magic numbers everywhere
.foregroundColor(Color(hex: "212529"))
.padding(20)
.cornerRadius(8)

// After: Semantic design tokens
.foregroundColor(AppTheme.Colors.primaryText)
.padding(AppTheme.Spacing.xl)
.cornerRadius(AppTheme.CornerRadius.small)
```

### 2. **Feature-Based Organization**
- Each feature has its own folder
- Easy to find related code
- Simple to add/remove features
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Reusable Components**
- Components properly separated
- Easy to share across features
- Consistent styling via AppTheme

### 4. **Type Safety**
- Centralized models
- Proper error handling
- Strong typing throughout

---

## 📚 Documentation Created

1. ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive architecture guide
2. ✅ `XCODE_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step Xcode setup
3. ✅ `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - This file!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Open Xcode and reorganize project navigator**
   - Follow `XCODE_SETUP.md` instructions
   - Takes about 10 minutes
   - Critical for Xcode to recognize new structure

2. **Build and test**
   - `Cmd + B` to build
   - `Cmd + R` to run
   - Verify all features work

### Short Term (Recommended)
3. **Refactor ContentView.swift**
   - Extract ExerciseCarouselView to Features/Home/
   - Extract ExerciseCardView to Shared/Components/
   - Use AppTheme for all styling

4. **Add ViewModels**
   - Implement MVVM pattern
   - Move business logic from views

5. **Add error handling**
   - Centralized error handling
   - User-friendly error messages

### Long Term (Future)
6. **Add unit tests**
7. **Add UI tests**
8. **Add documentation comments**
9. **Implement dependency injection**
10. **Add analytics**
