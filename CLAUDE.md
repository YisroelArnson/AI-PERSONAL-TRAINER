## Development Workflow

Before writing any code, describe your approach and wait for approval. Always ask clarifying questions before writing any code if requirements are ambiguous. If a task requires changes to more than 3 files, stop and break it into smaller tasks first.

### Workflow order
1. **Research** (`/research`) — Investigate technologies, patterns, or approaches
2. **Spec** (`/spec`) — Interview to surface edge cases and design decisions, then write to `docs/specs/`
3. **Plan** (`/plan`) — Create a phased implementation plan in `docs/plans/`
4. **Implement** (`/implement`) — Execute the plan with verification

Not every task needs all steps. Small bug fixes can skip straight to implementation. Research and spec can happen in either order depending on what you know going in.
