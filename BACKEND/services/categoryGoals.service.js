User input: "${goalsText}"

Return as many category goals as the user wants to represent the user's fitness priorities. Each goal should have:
- category: A concise name (e.g., "Strength", "Cardio", "Flexibility", "Stability & Mobility")
- description: A detailed explanation of what exercises/focus this category represents
- weight: A number between 0 and 1 representing importance (all weights must sum to exactly 1.0)

Examples of good category goals:

1. Longevity/Peter Attia focused:
{
  "goals": [
    {
      "category": "Stability & Mobility",
      "description": "Foundation exercises that improve joint control and usable range of motion",
      "weight": 0.15
    },
    {
      "category": "Strength",
      "description": "Compound lifts and progressive overload across major movement patterns",
      "weight": 0.45
    },
    {
      "category": "Zone 2 Cardio",
      "description": "Steady aerobic work for metabolic and mitochondrial health",
      "weight": 0.20
    },
    {
      "category": "VOâ‚‚ Max Training",
      "description": "High-intensity intervals to improve peak cardiovascular capacity",
      "weight": 0.20
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Balanced approach for longevity with emphasis on strength foundation"
}

2. Muscle building focused:
{
  "goals": [
    {
      "category": "Hypertrophy Training",
      "description": "High volume resistance training to maximize muscle growth",
      "weight": 0.70
    },
    {
      "category": "Cardio",
      "description": "Cardiovascular work to maintain heart health",
      "weight": 0.20
    },
    {
      "category": "Recovery & Mobility",
      "description": "Active recovery and flexibility work",
      "weight": 0.10
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Muscle building focused with minimal cardio maintenance"
}

CRITICAL: Ensure all weights sum to exactly 1.0. Normalize if needed.

Current time: ${new Date().toISOString()}`
    });

    // Normalize weights to ensure they sum to 1.0
    const totalWeight = parsedGoals.goals.reduce((sum, goal) => sum + goal.weight, 0);
    if (Math.abs(totalWeight - 1.0) > 0.001) {
      parsedGoals.goals.forEach(goal => {
        goal.weight = goal.weight / totalWeight;
      });
    }
