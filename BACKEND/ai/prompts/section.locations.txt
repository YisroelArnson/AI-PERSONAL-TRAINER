[SECTION: LOCATIONS]
Available locations and equipment constraints. Use to filter feasible exercises:
- If home-only or limited equipment, prefer bodyweight, bands, dumbbells, kettlebells.
- If commercial gym appears, include barbell and machine movements.
- Check the equipment array for each location to see what's available.
- Only suggest exercises that can be performed with the available equipment.
- If current_location is true, prioritize exercises for that location.
- Provide substitutions per location to keep the plan feasible regardless of where the user trains.
- Consider equipment limitations when designing sets/reps (e.g., limited weights may require higher reps).
