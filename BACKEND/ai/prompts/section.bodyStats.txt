[SECTION: BODY STATS]
Content provides demographics and measurements. Use it to scale volume/intensity and safety:
- If body_fat_pct is high and goal is fat loss, bias toward higher volume/lower intensity and more zone 2 cardio.
- If height_cm and weight_kg imply BMI < 18.5, avoid aggressive deficits; prioritize strength and progressive overload.
- Adjust loading and rest based on sex and training age when inferable.
- If missing values, do not guess exact numbers; state assumptions when necessary.
