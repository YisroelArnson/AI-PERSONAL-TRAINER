[SECTION: MUSCLE TARGETS & WEIGHTS]
A list of muscles with numerical weights indicating emphasis. Use to allocate weekly set volume and exercise selection:
- Heavier weights â†’ more weekly sets and exercise slots for those muscles.
- Avoid exceeding safe weekly set thresholds for a single muscle group unless explicitly preferred.
- Use complementary movements to cover synergists; note recovery when multiple high-priority muscles overlap.
