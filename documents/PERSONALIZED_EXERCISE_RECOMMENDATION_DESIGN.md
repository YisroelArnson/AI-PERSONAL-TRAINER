# Personalized Exercise Recommendation System Design

## Current State Analysis
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Supabase integration
- **Frontend**: Swift/SwiftUI iOS app
- **Current Recommendation System**: Basic prompt-based approach using OpenAI's API
- **User Data Available**: Basic profile, body stats, goals (muscle groups, categories)

## Design Plan for Personalized Exercise Recommendations

### 1. Enhanced Data Models
We need to extend the current data models to capture all required user data:

**New Database Tables Needed:**
- `workout_history` - track past workouts, exercises, sets, reps, weights
- `user_injuries` - injury history and restrictions
- `exercise_preferences` - liked/disliked exercises, difficulty preferences
- `available_equipment` - user's accessible equipment
- `exercise_library` - comprehensive exercise database
- `user_feedback` - post-workout ratings and adjustments

### 2. Core Recommendation Engine Design

#### A. Data Collection Service
- **UserProfileAggregator**: Collects all user data into a unified profile
- **WorkoutHistoryAnalyzer**: Analyzes patterns from past workouts
- **ProgressTracker**: Calculates strength gains, endurance improvements
- **InjuryManager**: Tracks injury history and restrictions

#### B. Exercise Scoring Algorithm
Multi-factor scoring system:
```javascript
Exercise Score = (
  Goal Alignment * 0.25 +
  Muscle Balance * 0.20 +
  Equipment Match * 0.15 +
  Injury Safety * 0.15 +
  Preference Match * 0.10 +
  Progression Suitability * 0.10 +
  Time Efficiency * 0.05
)
```

#### C. Intelligence Layer
- **Progressive Overload Engine**: Automatically adjusts weights/reps based on progress
- **Variation Generator**: Prevents plateaus by varying exercises
- **Recovery Optimizer**: Considers muscle recovery time
- **Periodization Planner**: Long-term progression planning

### 3. Implementation Structure

#### Backend Services (`BACKEND/services/`):
1. **userData.service.js** - Aggregate user profile data
2. **workoutAnalyzer.service.js** - Analyze workout history
3. **recommendationEngine.service.js** - Core recommendation logic
4. **exerciseScorer.service.js** - Score individual exercises
5. **progressionPlanner.service.js** - Handle progressive overload

#### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/recommendations` - Get daily recommendations
- `POST /api/recommendations/feedback` - Submit workout feedback
- `GET /api/recommendations/progression` - Get long-term plan
- `PUT /api/preferences/exercises` - Update exercise preferences

#### Frontend Components:
- **RecommendationView.swift** - Display recommendations
- **WorkoutFeedbackView.swift** - Rate completed workouts
- **ExercisePreferencesView.swift** - Manage preferences
- **ProgressDashboard.swift** - Show progression analytics

### 4. Machine Learning Integration
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend exercises based on similar users
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend based on exercise attributes
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Improve recommendations based on feedback
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predict optimal weights and reps

### 5. Real-time Adaptation
- **Morning Adjustments**: Based on sleep, soreness, energy levels
- **Pre-workout Modifications**: Based on available time/equipment
- **In-workout Adaptations**: Real-time adjustments during workout

### 6. Data Pipeline
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect user data from all sources
2. **Data Processing**: Clean and normalize data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features for ML
4. **Model Training**: Update recommendation models
5. **Scoring & Ranking**: Generate final recommendations

### 7. Key Features to Implement

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- Enhanced user data collection
- Basic recommendation algorithm
- Exercise scoring system
- Workout history tracking

#### Phase 2: Intelligence
- Machine learning models
- Progressive overload automation
- Injury prevention logic
- Equipment substitution suggestions

#### Phase 3: Personalization
- Advanced preference learning
- Social features (compare with similar users)
- Predictive analytics
- Integration with wearables

### 8. Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Cache user profiles and exercise scores
- **Batch Processing**: Process workout history in batches
- **Real-time Updates**: Quick updates for time-sensitive changes
- **Scalability**: Design for growing user base

### 9. Testing Strategy
- **A/B Testing**: Compare recommendation algorithms
- **User Feedback Loop**: Continuous improvement based on ratings
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track recommendation accuracy
- **Safety Testing**: Ensure injury prevention works correctly

### 10. Privacy & Security
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive health data
- **Consent Management**: Granular privacy controls
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old data
- **HIPAA Compliance**: If handling medical data

This design creates a sophisticated, personalized exercise recommendation system that adapts to each user's unique needs, preferences, and constraints while maintaining safety and promoting long-term fitness progression.
